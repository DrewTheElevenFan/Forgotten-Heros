# Forgotten-Heros
This is a Concept for an RPG called "Forgotten Heros". It'll take place in the realm of Arcanier. In this RPG you'll traverse the lands of Orcalium to the Mushroom Land! You'll encounter hundreds of enimies, from orcs to mushroom goblins to even dragon. As you explore you'll find plants, herbs, trees, and caves. Perhaps even ruins of a kingdom from long ago, you'll just have to find out! To make a reliable food source you may want to harvest seeds to grow crops. The possabilities are endless! This game is still being worked on in Godot 4.2. Now here is the fun part, I'll have the project files, concept art, and google doc linked at somepoint, that way you guys can feel free to help out on this project! Just contact me via discussions which I'll have on the actions page! With all that said I think that wraps up every thing, I'll link my stuff down below. PEACE everyone!
